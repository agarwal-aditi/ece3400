## Lab 1

In Lab 1, I learned how to program the Arduino, how to assemble a circuit with photoresistors, and how to view the input of photoresistors through using Arduino pins. 

### Blinking the LED

As an introduction to programming an Arduino, the first task of the lab was to blink an LED. After installing the Arduino IDE, I used the file given to us, `blink_LED.ino`. This code helped me learn how programming a microcontroller works, in which there is a setup sequence, and then a loop that continuosly runs on the Arduino everytime it is turned on until a new program gets loaded onto the Arduino or you press the RESET button. In the setup part of the code, the `LEDBUILTIN` pin, which is a "pin" that controls the LED that is already on the Arduino, is declared as an output so that the compiler can tell the Arduino that it is writing values to it to output onto the connected I/O device, which in this case is the built-in LED. In the loop part of the code, we first write a `HIGH` signal to the LED, which is a digital value that is high enough power to turn on the LED, then there is a delay, then we write `LOW` which turns the LED off, and then there is another delay.Â The delay between the writes to the LEDs is required in order to see any visible change since the clock speed of the Arduino is faster than we can see. After understanding how the code works, I programmed it to the Arduino, and saw that how I changed the delay time affected how fast the LED was blinking. 

### Building the Photosensor Circuits

After understanding how to program the Arduino, we got started on the first part of developing a Light Following robot. To get the Light Following Robot to follow light, I first needed to connect the photoresistors to the Arduino to sense light intensity. The CdS Photosensors are photoresistors in which as more light is detected (indcident light) at the sensor, the resistance value decreases so that the output voltage increases. This is because the photoresistor is a voltage divider circuit with the resistor that has incident light is on one side and a 10 kilo-ohms pull-down resistor is on the other side. The output voltage is connected to an analog input of the Arduino Nano so that its value can be read (from 0 to 1023) by the Arduino as a digital value. 

 Since it reads a value upto 1023, it was important to first calibrate the photoresistor to the regular lighting surroundings so that it will be able to detect a flashlight approximiatley 30 cm away. To do this, I first created a simple circuit with just one photosensor connected.

After creating this circuit, I used the `CdS_ReadA0.ino` code to read the value to the Serial Monitor.
