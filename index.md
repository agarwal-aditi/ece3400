## Lab 1

In Lab 1, I learned how to program the Arduino, how to assemble a circuit with photoresistors, and how to view the input of photoresistors through using Arduino pins. 

### Blinking the LED

As an introduction to programming an Arduino, the first task of the lab was to blink an LED. After installing the Arduino IDE, I used the file given to us, `blink_LED.ino`. This code helped me learn how programming a microcontroller works, in which there is a setup sequence, and then a loop that continuosly runs on the Arduino everytime it is turned on until a new program gets loaded onto the Arduino. In the code, the
